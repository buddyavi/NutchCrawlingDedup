ASCII to netCDF Conversion Guide UNIDATA: The definitive source for information regarding netCDF Unidata netCDF Homepage Rosetta Data Translation Tool Other References The following sites will be helpful in researching how to translate your project's data into netCDF. We suggest you first read the information on NetCDF from SEDNA. The 2007 Sea ice Experiment - Dynamic Nature of the Arctic (SEDNA) is using netCDF as the archive format for time series and model data, such as data from ice mass balance buoys. The guide they provide gives a quick and accessible overview of ASCII to netCDF conversion.
